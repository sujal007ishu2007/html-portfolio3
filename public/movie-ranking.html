   <h3>BEST TELUGU MOVIE</h3>
      <h4>ADBHUTAM</h4>
<P> IN the present time tollywood is the only industry in india who is releasing breaking records by making pan india and pan world flims but my favourite movie is not of that big movie but this movie is having the great concept of time . It gives us a message that "IF SOMETHING IS WRITTEN IN OUR DESTINY THEN EVEN TIME CANNOT CHANGE IT"<P>
