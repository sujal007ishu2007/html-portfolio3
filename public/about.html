<h1>About Me</h1>
<p> Greetings everyone! I'm Sujal, but feel free to call me Sujju. At 18 years young, I'm on an exhilarating journey through the world of technology and creativity. Currently, I'm in my second year of pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) with a burning passion for all things web development.</p>

 <p> üñ•Ô∏è As an aspiring web developer, I find my canvas in the digital realm, where I blend design and code to create immersive online experiences. From crafting stunning user interfaces to engineering seamless user experiences, I'm constantly driven to push the boundaries of what the web can offer. Whether it's mastering HTML, CSS, and JavaScript or diving into the exciting world of frameworks and libraries, I'm always eager to learn and apply new skills.</p>
<p> When I'm not immersed in the digital world, you'll often find me exploring various hobbies, connecting with diverse people, and nurturing my creative side. Whether it's sketching, playing a musical instrument, or simply enjoying the great outdoors, I believe that a well-rounded life adds depth and richness to one's journey.</p>
